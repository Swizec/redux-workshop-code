# Swizec's Redux Workshop Starter Repo

Your journey begins with [the starter repo](https://github.com/Swizec/redux-workshop-starter-repo).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Swizec/redux-workshop-starter-repo.git
$ cd redux-workshop-starter-repo
$ npm install
```

This gives you a project set up with `create-react-app` with everything you need to work on this project

- all dependencies
- an `Api` class that talks to StubHub
- StubHub auth set up with my tokens
- all files stubbed with
	- their imports
	- styled components
- routing setup
- redux store setup

In theory you should be able to focus just on React and Redux fundamentals and not have to worry about any boilerplate. You might have to comment out some imports until we implement them.
